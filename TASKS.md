## Backlog (priority)
- [x] **URGENT: Redesign Onboarding (Premium Vibe).** The current one is too basic. Make it look expensive: (Added layered mystical gradient + glow orbs, animated entry fade/slide, glassmorphism inputs w/ focus state, and Star Seed ID reveal animation.)
    - Use a full-screen, high-quality mystical background image (or complex gradient).
    - Animate the entry (fade-in, slide-up).
    - Use better input fields (glassmorphism with active states).
    - Add a "reveal" animation when generating the Star Seed ID.
- [x] Add monetization mockups (Stardust Gold upsell card). (Added Gold upsell card on Dashboard with badge, perks list, pricing row, and CTA.)
- [x] (Optional) Load a custom serif font with expo-font for consistent typography across platforms. (Added Cormorant Garamond font asset, expo-font loader, TypographyProvider with fallback.)

## Completed
- [x] Implement arcane + ethereal signature elements. (Added Living Nebula animated background, Constellation Sigil motion layer, and Cosmic Seal reveal styling.)
- [x] Fix/verify Expo dependencies and run app locally once. (Aligned react-native-screens to ~4.16.0; expo-doctor clean; Metro booted)
- [x] Add “AI Oracle Chat” screen (UI only, no backend yet). (Added OracleChat screen + navigation entry + CTA on dashboard)
- [x] Add a subtle animated starfield background component (reuse on both screens). (Added reusable Starfield component with twinkle animation on Dashboard + Oracle Chat)
- [x] Polish typography: add a serif title font + consistent spacing. (Introduced Georgia-based title font + typography helpers; aligned title/subtitle spacing and body text usage)
